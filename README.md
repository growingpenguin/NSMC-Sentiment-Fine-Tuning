# NSMC-Sentiment-Fine-Tuning
This repository is dedicated to the sentiment analysis of Korean movie reviews from the Naver Sentiment Movie Corpus (NSMC) <br/>
Using two state-of-the-art language models: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf and KT-AI/midm-bitext-S-7B-inst-v1 <br/>
## Repository Contents
**Fine-Tuned Models**: <br/>
The repository features two fine-tuned models, each tailored to accurately predict the sentiment of Korean text as either 'positive' or 'negative' <br/>
**Datasets**: <br/>
Included are the subsets of the NSMC dataset that were used: 9,000 samples for training and 1,000 for validation, enabling users to replicate or extend the fine-tuning process <br/>
**Training Scripts**: <br/>
Scripts that were used to fine-tune and validate the models, alongside the hyperparameters and configurations, offer insights into the fine-tuning process <br/>
**Performance Metrics**: <br/>
Detailed evaluation metrics are provided to assess the models' accuracy and performance improvements post fine-tuning <br/>
**Utilities**: <br/>
Utility scripts to handle environment setup, including dependency management and memory optimization, are available <br/>
**Documentation**: <br/>
Comprehensive guides and instructions explain the methodology, setup, and execution steps for utilizing the fine-tuned models <br/>
